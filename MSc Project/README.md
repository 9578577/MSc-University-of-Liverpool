# COMP702-FPGA-MSc-Project
This repository consists of work done in part for the final MSc project at the University of Liverpool. This project consisted of accelerating options pricing algorithms on a Pynq-Z2 and Alveo u200.

The results from this project can be found [here](https://github.com/mjcarter95/COMP702-FPGA-MSc-Project/tree/master/Results), a copy of the thesis will be added to this repository once the marking process is complete.

A user guide for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/mjcarter95/COMP702-FPGA-MSc-Project/blob/master/User%20Guide.pdf).

Where relevant, the folders for each algorithm contain a "Pynq-Z2", "HLS" and "SDAccel" subfolder. The Pynq-Z2 subfolder contains a notebook, python file and bitsreams for each algorithm. The SDAccel folder contains the host files required for these algorithms and the HLS folders contain the HLS code for each algorithm.
